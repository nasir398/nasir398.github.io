Machine Learning:

```
Machine Learning ( ML) is a sub branch of Artificial Intelligence which uses historical data to make better business decisions. ML is a process where machine take input, analysis and predict output. 
ML can analyze huge data sets, make predictions, optimize utility functions, and extract hidden data structure/pattern, fraud detection and classification of data. 
This enables software to learn and predict about futures. It can also be used to personalize contents as we see in Netflix, Facebook, Ecommerce site, Jobs resume parsing. 

```


ML learns the same way children learn :
It looks for pattern in the data, learns from its error, tries to get a good reward. 
```

```
Supervised learning :

The labels are known. The input and output are provided, the model then learns into predicting correct output.
Classification is used to put label on a group of data. Which means ML can predict for a given data that in which category it will fall. Result is true or false. 
Regression is used to predict a continuous number. For example the temperature tomorrow afternoon. 
Supervised uses human teacher's to tell the models which outputs are correct and which are not. 
Input >> Model >> Output
Here the model learns from a large dataset, for each output changes the weight and reduces error for each iteration. 

Unsupervised learning (Self Organized Learning) :
There is no teacher to label the data, model is presented with the whole data. Model then detects emerging properties in the input data and constructs patterns or clusters. 
Like grouping customers which have similar trend in shopping. 


Reinforcement :
Software identifies an ideal behavior within a specific context for a particular problem. It takes the input and decides the best action for the problem, receives a reward for the solution.  
Inspired behavior psychology.

Difference between AI , ML and DL 
Artificial Intelligence makes computers smart by mimicking human cognitive, general field with board scope including computer vision, language processing. 

Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers statistical part of AI. It teaches computer to solve problems by looking at data samples, learning from it and then using this technique to solve similar problem in different situations. 

Deep Learning is a special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. DL involves deeper level of automation as compared to normal software.
