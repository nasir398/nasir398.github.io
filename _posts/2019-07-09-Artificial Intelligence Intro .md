Artificial Intelligence,:

```
AI in simplest term is any intelligent behavior by a machine. Any device that can take input from its environment and give useful output is AI. 
Machines like humans depend on learning which brings us to our next topic
```


Knowledge Engineering: :

Machines needs extensive knowledge of real world for example cause and process, the way human do. 
Feeding data to a software program and coming to a conclusion just like a human would do in those given circumstances. 
AI is important because it gives us new dimension in business to make us grow, therefore all majors companies are using AI. 

```

```
Effective AI strategy:
At organizational level one would require fast computing environment, Ubiquitous data and advance learning algorithms. 

```
Difference between AI , ML and DL 
Artificial Intelligence makes computers smart by mimicking human cognitive, general field with board scope including computer vision, language processing. 

Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers statistical part of AI. It teaches computer to solve problems by looking at data samples, learning from it and then using this technique to solve similar problem in different situations. 

Deep Learning is a special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. DL involves deeper level of automation as compared to normal software.
